Project: Covid19-Detection using CNNs

After learning basics of ML, this phase involved learning about implementing a basic layer of Convolutional Neural Networks,
looking at case studies of previously implemented CNNs like ResNets, MobileNets, EffecientNets,etc.
We solved a couple of assignments based on MNSIT classification of digits, using keras to implement a neural network for binary classification.
I read a research paper on using CNNs for Covid10-Detection using the images of patients lungs and have been implementing it
