We are still in the learning phase of this project so I have done some assignments and am doing the ML course by Andrew NG on Coursera.
The assignments provide a hands on learning experience of the things learnt from the course.
The first assignment involved learning the basics of Python and GIT and I learnt some basic libaries like numpy for arrays and 
openCV, matplotlib,PIL for reading , processing and plotting images and histograms. I even tried edge detection as a start in image processing.
I also learnt basic GIT commands like cloning a project,add,commit,push,status,adding new branches and merging them,etc.
The second assignment was based on gradient descent and linear regression learnt from the ML course. We first tried gradient descent manually,
plotted and analayzed it and then used the scikit-learn library which directly performs gradient descent.
The third assignment involved logistic regression and also involved gradient descent. Similar to assignment 2, we first performed it
manually and then used functions from scikit-learn library to do it for us.
Apart from this I also learnt other different things based on ML from the course like multivariate linear regression, normal equation
(to directly solve gradient descent), solving the problem of overfitting,etc. 
I am currently also learning about neural networks which is more directly related to our project and thus seems more interesting and
is also the topic of our last assignment before the midsem break.
